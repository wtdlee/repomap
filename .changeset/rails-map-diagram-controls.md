### Rails Map Diagram Enhancements

- **Dynamic Zoom Range**: Max zoom automatically scales based on diagram size (up to 500x for large diagrams)
- **Namespace Filter**: Now detects common prefixes (e.g., `User*` for User, UserProfile, UserSetting)
- **Focus Model with Depth**: Select a model to see only related models within specified depth (1-5)
- **Full Height Container**: Diagram area now stretches to fill available viewport height
- **Always Visible Depth Control**: Depth selector is always visible but disabled until Focus model is selected
