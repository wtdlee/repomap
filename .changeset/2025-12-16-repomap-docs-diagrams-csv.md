Add diagram copy/download controls (Mermaid source, SVG, PNG) to docs and rails-map, add human-readable CSV export for selected pages in page-map, inline the SVG icon sprite to avoid 404s in static builds, and improve `serve` behavior (open browser by default and refresh an existing server when already running).
